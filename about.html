          <p>
            my name is Karimah Ahmad a builder and an educator who transitioned
            into tech. I started up with product management, but curiosity led
            me to study something outside product. Here i am a Frontend
            Developer. I'm Kaduna born and bred, currently living in Bauchi
            State. I'm married and blessed with three amazing kids. My
            professional journey has been a mix of learning, building, and
            evolving. From the classroom to tech spaces, I've continued to push
            myself to grow, explore new ideas, and create solutions that make a
            difference. I'm passionate about innovation, collaboration, and
            helping others find their path, just like I found mine.

          <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>

          <p>
            My goal in the HNG program is to stretch beyond my comfort zone and
            gain hands-on experience that sharpens both my technical and soft
            skills. I want to deepen my understanding of real-world
            problem-solving, learn to collaborate effectively in diverse teams,
            and deliver results that speak to innovation and quality. I also aim
            to build a strong network of like-minded innovators while improving
            my confidence in executing tasks independently and creatively.

          <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>

          <p>
            I sometimes find myself second-guessing my technical abilities,
            especially when faced with unfamiliar tools or complex challenges. I
            also tend to overthink my outputs, worrying if they meet
            expectations. However, i am learning to trust the process to ask
            questions, seek feedback early, and focus on progress rather than
            perfection.

          <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>

          <p>
            Dear Future Me, You've come a long way from where you started. Every
            challenge that once made you nervous became a stepping stone to
            something bigger. Keep that fire alive, the one that pushes you to
            learn, adapt, and grow. Remember, the goal isn't just to finish
            strong but to evolve continuously. Celebrate your wins, stay humble,
            and never forget why you started.

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            This journey is more than just an internship it's an opportunity to
            redefine what's possible. I'm excited to see how each task, feedback
            session, and collaboration contributes to my personal and
            professional transformation. I'm ready to learn, unlearn, and build
            something remarkable with the HNG community.
